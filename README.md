# Single-Cycle RISC_V Processor
32-bit single-cycle microarchitecture RISC-V processor based on Harvard Architecture. 
The single-cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle. In other words, instruction fetch, instruction decode, 
execute, write back, and programcounterupdate occurs within a single clock cycle. The microprocessor was tested to execute Fibonacci 
Series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ....).
